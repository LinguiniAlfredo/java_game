## 3D Game Engine
A 3D game engine with built-in editor. Ported and expanded upon my C++ 3D engine. 
Still WIP...

### TODO
* Fix camera orientation on editor start and play start
* Fix rotate/scale gizmo functionality
* Multi-select objects and move, or implement entity hierarchy 
* Two-plane translation gizmo 
* Render text to screen api
  * status notifications that fade after a few seconds, "editor mode", "wireframe on", etc.
